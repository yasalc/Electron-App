# 🏗️ Electron Build Guide - Complete Walkthrough

## 📋 What You Have Now

Your Student Management System has been converted to a desktop application with:

✅ **Screen Recording Detection** - Monitors for OBS, Bandicam, Camtasia, etc.  
✅ **Automatic Security Blocking** - Hides video content when recording detected  
✅ **GitHub Actions Build Pipeline** - Automatically compiles Windows executable  
✅ **Security Event Logging** - All violations logged to Supabase  
✅ **Desktop Application Wrapper** - Professional desktop app experience  

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Student downloads and installs** your Windows application
2. **App monitors system processes** every 3 seconds in background
3. **When recording software detected** → Content automatically hidden + Alert shown
4. **All security events logged** to your Supabase database for monitoring
5. **Students can't bypass** the protection (requires closing recording software)

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Create GitHub repository** at https://github.com/new
   - Name: `student-management-system-desktop`
   - Set to Public or Private
   - Add README + .gitignore (Node)

2. **Upload all project files**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
   
   # Copy all files from this project into the cloned folder
   # Then:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Electron desktop app with screen recording detection"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Phase 2: Automatic Build (10 minutes)

3. **GitHub Actions automatically builds your app**:
   - Go to repository → Actions tab
   - Watch "Build Electron App" workflow run
   - Takes ~8-10 minutes to complete

4. **Download your executable**:
   - Click on completed workflow
   - Download "student-management-system-windows" artifact
   - Extract ZIP → You have your `.exe` file!

### Phase 3: Testing (15 minutes)

5. **Test the application**:
   - Right-click `.exe` → "Run as administrator"
   - Test login/registration
   - Open OBS Studio
   - Try accessing video content → Should be blocked!

### Phase 4: Distribution (5 minutes)

6. **Share with students**:
   - Upload to Google Drive/OneDrive
   - Or use GitHub Releases page
   - Provide installation instructions

## 📊 Security Monitoring Dashboard

After deployment, monitor security events in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check recent security violations
SELECT * FROM security_events 
WHERE event_type = 'recording_detected' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Count violations by student
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as violation_count
FROM security_events 
WHERE event_type = 'recording_detected'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY violation_count DESC;
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Modify Detection Sensitivity
In `main.js`, line ~15:
```javascript
// Add more recording software to detect
const RECORDING_SOFTWARE = [
  'obs64.exe', 'obs32.exe',
  'bandicam.exe',
  'your-custom-software.exe'  // Add more here
];
```

### Change Detection Interval
In `main.js`, line ~120:
```javascript
// Currently checks every 3 seconds
detectionInterval = setInterval(checkForRecording, 3000);
// Change to 5 seconds: setInterval(checkForRecording, 5000);
```

### Custom Security Responses
In `renderer/0cj1zfmo29.html`, around line 4470:
```javascript
function handleRecordingDetected(detectionData) {
  // Customize what happens when recording is detected
  // Current: Shows alert + hides content + logs to database
  // You can add: Email alerts, automatic logout, etc.
}
```

## 📈 Advanced Features You Can Add

### 1. Email Alerts for Violations
Add to `handleRecordingDetected()`:
```javascript
// Send email alert to admin
await fetch('your-email-service-endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: 'admin@lawschool.com',
    subject: 'Security Violation Alert',
    message: `Student ${currentUser.name} attempted to record content`
  })
});
```

### 2. Automatic Screenshot Evidence
```javascript
// Take screenshot when violation detected
const screenshot = await electronAPI.takeScreenshot();
await supabase.storage.from('evidence').upload(`violation-${Date.now()}.png`, screenshot);
```

### 3. Watermarking Video Content
```javascript
// Add student info overlay to videos
const watermark = document.createElement('div');
watermark.textContent = `${currentUser.name} - ${currentUser.nic}`;
watermark.style.cssText = 'position:absolute;top:10px;right:10px;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.7);';
videoContainer.appendChild(watermark);
```

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### For Students:
- **Must run as Administrator** for detection to work
- **Cannot disable detection** without closing app
- **All attempts logged** even if detection bypassed
- **Works offline** for logged-in sessions

### For Administrators:
- **Monitor Supabase logs** regularly for violations
- **Review security_events table** for patterns
- **Block repeat violators** via admin portal
- **Update detection list** as new recording software emerges

## 🔄 Update Process

When you need to update the app:

1. **Modify your code**
2. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
3. **GitHub Actions builds new version automatically**
4. **Download new executable**
5. **Redistribute to students**

## 🎉 Success Metrics

After deployment, you should see:

✅ **Students can't record videos** without detection  
✅ **Security violations logged** in your Supabase dashboard  
✅ **Professional desktop app experience** for students  
✅ **Automatic updates** via GitHub Actions  
✅ **Admin oversight** of all security events  

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**App won't build on GitHub Actions**
→ Check package.json syntax, ensure all files committed

**Students can't install**
→ Provide clear admin privileges instructions

**Detection not working**
→ Verify app running as administrator

**Performance issues**
→ Increase detection interval from 3 to 5 seconds
