   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application features"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **GitHub Actions will automatically build a new version**
4. **Download the new executable from the Actions tab**

## üì± Distribution to Students

### Option 1: Direct Download
- Share the GitHub repository link
- Students download from Releases page
- Provide installation instructions

### Option 2: Direct File Sharing
- Download the built executable
- Share via Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.
- Include installation guide
