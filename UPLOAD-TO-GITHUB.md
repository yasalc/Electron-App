All files in this "Electron App" folder should be uploaded to GitHub:

- `.gitignore` - Ignore unnecessary files

### Web Application Files:
- `renderer/` folder (contains all HTML files)
  - `renderer/index.html` - Portal selector

  - `renderer/47gwy2ga4a.html` - Admin portal  
  - `renderer/44drn7nkwr.html` - Password reset

## ðŸš« Don't Upload These (They're Not in This Folder):

The following files from the original directory are NOT needed for the Electron app:
- `netlify-deployment-guide.md` (only for web deployment)
- `YOUWARE.md` (internal documentation)
- `docs/` folder (documentation archive)

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Upload Steps:

1. **Create new GitHub repository**
2. **Clone the repository locally**
3. **Copy ALL files from this "Electron App" folder** to your cloned repo
4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Electron desktop app with screen recording detection"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. **Wait for GitHub Actions to build** your executable (10 minutes)
6. **Download the built .exe file** from the Actions tab

## ðŸŽ¯ Result:

After upload, GitHub Actions will automatically:
- âœ… Install Node.js dependencies
- âœ… Build Windows executable
- âœ… Create downloadable artifacts
- âœ… Generate release files

**Your desktop application with screen recording detection will be ready to download!**
